I can reproduce this problem with the current release 1.219.

I have subscribed to the rss feed "Hudson all builds".

I review the links inside and click on one of them from Firefox (2.0.0.14). Works (is also broken) also with Internet Explorer 7.0.5730.13.

I click on the the Previous Build and/or Next Build, if available, and get the 404 page not found error.

My links look similar to the ones already posted.

http://hudson:9090/hudson/job/Pojo/16/ [from rss feed]

http://hudson:9090/hudson/job/Pojo/156/ [previous build]

156 does not exist.

I hope this helps find the bug and solve the problem.
